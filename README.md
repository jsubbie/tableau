# tableau

Assorted Tableau Notes - 

- GREEN and BLUE PILLS = Values and Dimensions (respectively) 

- You can import multiple data sources, but the sorting (data consolidation) is iffy (at best). Recommend cleaning all data prior to import to save yourself the headache. That being said, remember - that in a pinch - importing multiple CSVs or spreadsheets is possible. 

- Properties can be changed in order to satisfy the desired table requirements. For instance, you can change dimensions into values. I recommend keeping a seperate changelog if youre toodling about and not likely to remember what you did after you do something cool.
